# Year-11-CS-Unit-1-Lab-HowManyPages

There is a folk rule stating the number of pages you should read before giving up on a book is 100 - your age. For example, a 21 year old needs to read 79 pages ( 100 - 21 ).
Write a program that stores your age as an integer in a variable named age. The program then computes and displays the minimal number of pages to read.

A sample run could be:

Prompt + input : 
Enter your age: 18

Output: 
18 year olds should read at least 82 pages before giving up on a book.

or  

Prompt + input : 
Enter your age: 30

Output : 
30 year olds should read at least 70 pages before giving up on a book.
